In other modules we have talked about Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, the natural and cultural resources it protects, and the threats that these resources are facing. Although some of these threats are out of our control, many are caused by humans. The good news is that there are things that you (and your customers) can do to help.

In this module, you will learn about “reef etiquette” - simple actions that you can take (and teach your customers) to help protect coral reefs and minimize our impact on them, both in and out of the water.

## Diving and Snorkeling Etiquette

### What can you do in the water?

The Florida Keys encompass the longest barrier reef in the continental United States and attract over 700,000 divers and snorkelers each year. With so many people in the water, every reef interaction (no matter how small) can be harmful to the fragile corals and 6,000 marine species that call the Florida Keys home.

Fortunately, there are many things you can do to prevent damage to corals and the marine ecosystem. Many of these actions may seem basic to those of us who are on the water all of the time, but by passing this knowledge on to new divers and snorkelers, you are helping these behaviors become accepted habits. Check out the topics illustrated below to learn more.

Even a minor brush with hands or fins can damage delicate coral animals and can even hurt you, as some corals can sting or cut. Stray fins can also stir up sand that can smother coral animals.&nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">FKNMS</span></p></div>

If you need to rest or adjust equipment, lie on your back or float in a seated position. If you need to stand to adjust equipment, return to the boat.&nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">FKNMS</span></p></div>

Use proper dive posture, with feet remaining slightly elevated above the head. Novice snorkelers can use a snorkel vest to stay afloat.&nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">FKNMS</span></p></div>

### The Blue Star Difference

By taking this course, you have already committed to preserving the livelihood of the Florida Keys marine ecosystem. And while an environmental briefing aboard a dive or snorkel charter may seem like a small step, multiple studies show just how effective Blue Star Operators are at protecting the Florida Keys reefs.

In 2012, researchers observed divers from Blue Star operated and non-Blue Star operated dive charters in Key Largo. One study found that nearly all divers (97%) interacted with the reef during their dive (Douglas and Camp, 2012). In the other study, researchers calculated that most recreational divers contact live stony coral approximately 18 times per dive, usually with fins, hands, or dangling dive gear (Krieger and Chadwick, 2012). 

However, non-Blue Star divers were over two times more likely to interact with the reef than divers from Blue Star operations (Douglas and Camp, 2012). The same trend was found for coral touches (Douglas and Camp, 2012, Krieger and Chadwick, 2012). Non-Blue Star divers deposited approximately twice the amount of sediment onto live corals than Blue Star divers (Krieger and Chadwick, 2012). The studies concluded that receiving a higher level of conservation education did influence diver behavior in the water and reduced the frequency of reef interactions (Douglas and Camp, 2012).

### What can you do off the water?

Protection of our reefs can continue long after leaving the water. Even if your customers live far from reefs, they still have an impact on reef health and conservation. By bringing awareness to simple lifestyle changes, you can help make sure these impacts are positive.
