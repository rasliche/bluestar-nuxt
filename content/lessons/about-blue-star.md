## Introduction

The Florida Keys are home to North America’s only continental barrier reef. This reef brings millions of visitors to the keys every year to dive, snorkel, fish, and participate in a number of other recreational opportunities. The recreational experiences your business provides helps visitors make memories and also helps connect them to an important natural wonder that they will never forget. While visiting the Florida Keys, these guests have the potential to impact our reefs in both positive and negative ways. As a recreation provider in this unique ecosystem, you are on the front lines of ensuring the reef stays healthy for generations to come. Thank you for taking the time to educate your guests and be a part of the solution in protecting Florida’s coral reef. 

The Blue Star program is a volunteer recognition program that works with charter boat operators to help promote responsible and sustainable diving, snorkeling, and fishing practices in the Florida Keys. The Blue Star Program is important because studies show that damage caused to the reef by recreational divers, snorkelers, and anglers are reduced when customers are provided an onboard briefing that focuses on reef-safe practices and reef etiquette.

In this section, you will learn about the Blue Star program, the Blue Star briefing, and the requirements to be a Blue Star operator.

## About Blue Star

### What is Blue Star?

The Blue Star program, established by Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, is a voluntary recognition program saluting charter boat operators who promote responsible and sustainable diving, snorkeling and fishing practices, helping keep Florida Keys ecosystems healthy for generations to come.

As a Blue Star business, you play a critical role in helping to protect our reefs. By joining this program you are passing on important lessons about the coral reef ecosystem,Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, diving and snorkeling etiquette on coral reefs, and sustainable fishing practices which is essential in helping to protect our reefs.

### Why Blue Star?

Most of the visitors coming to the Florida Keys will participate in an on-the-water recreational activity. Florida’s coral reef has faced many challenges and stresses over the past decades, one of which being the increased usage by recreational snorkelers and divers as well as increased fishing pressure. As a Blue Star partner, you have the opportunity to reduce their negative impact and help your guests enjoy the reef in a safe and responsible way. Studies have shown that guests who are educated by Blue Star operators are less likely to engage in reef damaging behaviors.

## The Heart of Blue Star- The Blue Star Dive Briefing

From 2010 to 2012 two separate research studies were conducted in the Florida Keys to determine how a pre-dive education briefing can influence diver impacts on coral reefs. Research has shown that divers on Blue Star recognized charters “cause significantly less coral damage than do divers from other types of dive shops” (Kreiger & Chadwick, 2012). Dive briefings administered by Blue Star Operators are likely the contributing factor that limits diver contact with the reefs. 

On average, recreational SCUBA divers come in contact with live coral eighteen times per dive (Kreiger & Chadwick, 2012). Many touches are caused by fin kicks or loose equipment dragging on the reef (Camp & Fraser, 2012). The incorporation of conservation education into onboard briefings improves customer understanding of environmental threats and gives them a last-minute reminder to be cautious of their behavior while underwater, limiting coral contact. According to Krieger and Chadwick (2012), customers who received dive briefings that meet Blue Star requirements prior to entering the water caused considerably less reef damage than customers who did not. 

It is estimated that due to increasingly high rates of recreational diving on sites in Key Largo alone, over 80% of live coral colonies have been damaged and some heavily dived sites have seen a reduction in live coral to less than 5% of the total cover. Given that the proportion of damaged corals on each reef increases tremendously with estimated rates of recreational SCUBA diving on those sites, diver education with the goal of reducing reef contact is essential to ensuring tourism rates are both economically and environmentally sustainable. The effort of Blue Star operators to train their staff and promote environmental stewardship is essential to the conservation of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. 

The Blue Star program is one way that you can show customers – people who were drawn to the area because of the environment in the first place – that you, and the business that you work for, care about the ecosystem and are committed to doing your part to protect it. Please take the time to memorize each component of the Blue Star briefing. You can incorporate these components into your current briefing. Feel free to add your own style while making sure you include each required section. You are required to give the Blue Star briefing on every trip that you take.

## Blue Star Requirements- Understanding the Framework

Blue Star operators have made a commitment to train their staff and customers to be better environmental stewards. As part of the program, staff who work at Blue Star recognized dive shops complete this online training each year on issues affecting coral reefs, sanctuary regulations, and coral reef etiquette. Staff will then educate their customers on these topics. This includes making sure to do a Blue Star briefing on each trip that you take before your customers participate in any activities like diving or fishing. Blue Star Diving Operators also commit to offering conservation-related speciality courses and participate in activities such as fish counts and reef clean-ups.

Once a business has gone through the initial evaluation and is recognized as a Blue Star partner, they will be reevaluated each year, to ensure that the Blue Star criteria are still being followed.

Make sure you are familiar with the current year's [Blue Star framework](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/bluestar/become.html), which outlines the specifics of what each operator is required to do to be “Blue Star recognized.” As a staff member at a Blue Star operation, we are depending on you to be familiar with this framework and properly implement the Blue Star Diving program to help protect the beauty of the Florida Keys for future generations.
