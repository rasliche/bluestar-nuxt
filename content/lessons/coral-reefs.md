## Introduction

Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary protects the most extensive living coral reef system in North America. This reef ecosystem is the foundation for our islands’ culture and community, providing livelihoods, creating new opportunities, and supporting the conch way of life. Because we rely on the reef to support us, it is important that we take responsibility for protecting it and ensuring that our time using it does not damage it beyond repair. As a recreation professional, you play a large role in ensuring the reef’s health during your visit and also in giving your customer the knowledge they need to support the reef from afar. 

In this section you will learn about the biology of corals, the reef ecosystem, and how our culture has been built around this critical ecosystem.

## Coral Biology and Feeding

Corals are a unique species that are made up of thousands of tiny animals called polyps. A coral polyp is an invertebrate that ranges from the size of a pinhead to up to a foot in diameter. Each polyp has a saclike body and a mouth encircled by stinging tentacles. Polyps use [calcium carbonate](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coralmadeof.html) from seawater to build a hard skeleton to protect their delicate bodies.

Symbiotic relationships are where plants or animals of different species may be dependent on one another for survival. The coral polyps engage in a [symbiotic relationship](https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/fullmoon-coralandalgae/welcome.html) with a type of algae called zooxanthellae that creates food for the polyp. In turn, the coral polyps provide the algae with carbon dioxide and a protective home. Polyps are also able to actively feed themselves. At night, polyps come out of their skeletons and stretch their long, stinging tentacles to capture tiny floating animals called zooplankton. The prey is pulled into the polyps’ mouths and digested in their stomachs.

In order to survive, corals rely on specific conditions. They need clear water so that the zooxanthellae has access to sunlight. They also need warm water, and generally live in areas where water temperatures are between 68-90 degrees F. Because corals are sensitive to pollution and sediments, the water must be clean and maintain a specific salinity.

This video will explain more about what corals are and the symbiotic relationships that are necessary for survival:

How is this possible?&nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">Ocean Today/NOAA</span></p></div>

## Reproduction in Corals

Corals can’t move around the ocean floor, they use spawning as their mating behavior. During spawning, corals release eggs and sperm into the water column, where they can be fertilized.

## Coral Reefs

Coral reefs are massive structures made of limestone deposited by coral polyps. Often referred to as the “rainforests of the sea,” coral reefs provide homes for more than 4,000 species of fish, 700 species of coral, and thousands of other plants and animals.

### Reef Builders

<div class="image-caption my-8 rounded-md"><div class="rounded-md overflow-hidden"><img src="https://coralreef.noaa.gov/aboutcrcp/news/featuredstories/mar15/resources/elkhorncoral_sefsc_750.jpg" /></div><p class="text-sm text-center">Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata).&nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">NOAA Fisheries</span></p></div>

The architects of coral reefs are hard corals. Unlike soft corals, like sea fans, hard corals have stony skeletons made out of limestone that are produced by coral polyps. When polyps die, their skeletons are left behind and used as foundations for new polyps. An actual coral branch or mound is composed of layers of skeletons covered by a thin layer of living polyps.

If a coral reef is likened to a bustling city, then a coral colony is like a single apartment building with many rooms and hallways that house different marine species.

### Types of Coral Reefs

Coral reefs are classified into [three types](https://marinesanctuary.org/blog/the-three-types-of-coral-reefs/): fringing reefs, atolls, and barrier reefs.

The most common type of reef is the fringing reef. Fringing reefs grow near the coastline around islands and land masses, and are separated from the shore by narrow, shallow lagoons. Atolls form when a fringing reef continues to grow upward from a volcanic island that has sunk entirely below sea level. Atolls are usually circular in shape with an open lagoon in the center. Similar to fringing reefs, barrier reefs also border a shoreline. However, they are separated by deeper, wider lagoons.

<div class="image-caption my-8 rounded-md"><div class="rounded-md overflow-hidden"><img src="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_corals/media/coral04a_480.gif" /></div><p class="text-sm text-center">This animation shows the dynamic process of how a coral atoll forms. Corals (represented in tan and purple) begin to settle and grow around an oceanic island forming a fringing reef. It can take as long as 10,000 years for a fringing reef to form. Over the next 100,000 years, if conditions are favorable, the reef will continue to expand. As the reef expands, the interior island usually begins to subside and the fringing reef turns into a barrier reef. When the island completely subsides beneath the water leaving a ring of growing coral with an open lagoon in its center, it is called an atoll. The process of atoll formation may take as long as 30,000,000 years to occur.&nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">National Ocean Service/NOAA</span></p></div>

### In the Florida Keys

Florida is the only state in the continental United States to have extensive shallow coral reefs near its coasts. The Florida Keys are home to the only living coral barrier reef system in the continental United States. The tract stretches for nearly 150 miles in length and is about four miles wide. All but the northernmost extent of the reef tract lies within the boundaries of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

## Value of Coral Reefs

### A Healthy Economy

From tourism to marine recreation and sport fishing, coral reefs play an important role in the economies of countries all around the world. By one estimate, coral reefs provide economic goods and services worth about $375 billion each year. NOAA suggests that coral reefs in southeast Florida have an asset value of $8.5 billion, generating $4.4 billion in local sales, $2 billion in local income, and 70,400 full and part-time jobs.

You can read more about how coral reefs support a fishing and tourism economy though the [Blue Star Fishing Guides](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/sep18/noaa-and-guides-partner-for-sustainable-fishing.html) program.

### Animals that Live Nowhere Else

Covering less than one percent of the ocean floor, coral reefs support an estimated 25 percent of all known marine species. And the variety of species living on coral reefs is greater than almost anywhere else in the world. Scientists estimate that more than one million species of plants and animals are associated with coral reef ecosystems. 

With its extensive reef tract, Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary protects more than 50 species of coral, including the federally protected Staghorn and Elkhorn corals. The sanctuary is also home to more than 500 species of fish and countless other types of marine life.

### Fishing

The fish that grow and live on coral reefs are a significant food source for people worldwide. In the United States, about half of all federally managed fisheries depend on coral reefs. NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service estimates the annual commercial value of U.S. fisheries from coral reefs to be over $100 million. Reef-based recreational fisheries generate over $100 million annually in the United States.

### Shoreline Protection

The rough surfaces and complex structures of healthy coral reefs can absorb up to 90 percent of the energy created by wind-generated waves. By breaking up the force of waves before they reach the coast, coral reefs serve as a buffer, protecting inshore areas from pounding waves. Coastlines protected by reefs are more stable, in terms of erosion, than those without. Reefs are also a source of sand in natural beach replenishment.

### Medicine Cabinets of the Sea

Since corals are stationary animals, many have evolved chemical defenses to protect themselves from predators. Scientists continue to research the medicinal potential of these substances. Plants and animals from reefs are important sources of new medicines being developed to treat cancer, arthritis, bacterial infections, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, viruses, and other diseases. In the future, coral reef ecosystems could also represent an important source of nutritional supplements, pesticides, cosmetics, and other commercial products.
