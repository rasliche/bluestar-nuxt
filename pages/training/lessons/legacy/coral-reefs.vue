    </h2>
    <p class="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed my-2">
      Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary protects the most extensive living
      coral reef system in North America. These reefs are intricately tied to
      our area’s economy, attracting tourists for diving, snorkeling, and other
      recreational opportunities and providing homes for many commercially
      important fish species.
    </p>

    <p class="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed my-2">
      In this section, you will learn about the biology of corals, about coral
      reefs, and why reefs are important to the economy.

      Coral Biology and Feeding
    </h2>

    <p class="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed my-2">
      Corals are a unique species that are made up of thousands of tiny animals
      called polyps. A coral polyp is an invertebrate that ranges from the size
      of a pinhead to up to a foot in diameter. Each polyp has a saclike body
      and a mouth encircled by stinging tentacles. Polyps use calcium carbonate
      from seawater to build a hard skeleton to protect their delicate bodies.
    </p>

      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed my-2">
      The polyps engage in a symbiotic relationship with a type of algae called
      zooxanthellae that creates food for the polyp. In turn, the polyps provide
      the algae with carbon dioxide and a protective home. Polyps are also able
      to actively feed themselves; at night, polyps come out of their skeletons
      and stretch their long, stinging tentacles to capture tiny floating
      animals called zooplankton. The prey is pulled into the polyps’ mouths and
      digested in their stomachs.
    </p>

    <p class="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed my-2">
      In order to survive, corals rely on specific conditions. They need clear
      water so that the zooxanthellae have access to sunlight. They also need
      warm water, and generally live in areas where water temperatures are
      between 68-90 degrees F. Because corals are sensitive to pollution and
      sediments, the water must be clean and maintain a specific salinity.

      Reproduction
    </h2>

    <p class="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed my-2">
      Because corals can’t move around the ocean floor, they have to find
      another way to mate. They do so through coral spawning, a mass event where
      coral larvae are released and fertilized within the body of a polyp or in
      the water.

      The architects of coral reefs are hard corals. Unlike soft corals, hard
      corals have stony skeletons made out of limestone that are produced by
      coral polyps. When polyps die, their skeletons are left behind and used as
      foundations for new polyps. An actual coral branch or mound is composed of
      layers of skeletons covered by a thin layer of living polyps.

      Coral reefs are classified into three types: fringing reefs, atolls, and
      barrier reefs.
    </p>

    <p class="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed my-2">
      The most common type of reef is the fringing reef. Fringing reefs grow
      near the coastline around islands and land masses, and are separated from
      the shore by narrow, shallow lagoons. Atolls form when a fringing reef
      continues to grow upward from a volcanic island that has sunk entirely
      below sea level. Atolls are usually circular in shape with an open lagoon
      in the center. Similar to fringing reefs, barrier reefs also border a
      shoreline. However, they are separated by deeper, wider lagoons.

      The rough surfaces and complex structures of healthy coral reefs can

      breaking up the force of waves before they reach the coast, coral reefs
      serve as a buffer, protecting inshore areas from pounding waves.
      Coastlines protected by reefs are more stable, in terms of erosion, than

      quiz: `Quiz
[Correct answer in bold; when correct answer is chosen, a congrats message should pop up (“You are correct!”). Text that should pop up if an incorrect answer is chosen appears in brackets.]

1. Corals are:
	a. animals
	b. plants
	c. rocks

[Not quite! What we typically call a “coral” is in fact composed of thousands of tiny, fragile animals call polyps. Unlike plants, coral polyps do not make their own food. And unlike rocks, corals are in fact alive.]


2. Many reef-building corals get their food from tiny algae called:
	a. diatoms
	b. chloroplants
	c. zooxanthellae
	d. seaweed


[Not quite! Corals have a unique relationship, called a symbiosis, with tiny algae called zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae live in the tissue of coral polyps, supplying the coral with food generated by photosynthesis.]


3. Coral polyps can catch and digest prey.
	a. True
	b. False

[Not quite! Each coral polyp has a saclike body and a tiny mouth that is circled by long, stinging tentacles. At night, polyps come out of their skeletons to feed, turning a reef into a hungry wall of mouths. Tentacles capture tiny floating animals and bring them to the polyps’ mouths for digestion in the polyps’ stomachs.]


4. What is the process of fertilizing coral larvae in the water called?
	a. exterior fertilization
	b. spawning
	c. cloning
	d. none of the above

[Not quite! One way that corals reproduce is by spawning, whereby polyps release up to one million eggs into the sea. The fertilized eggs settle on hard surfaces, where they change into polyps and begin to grow, eventually forming a new colony.]


5. What conditions do corals need to survive?
	a. Clear water
	b. Warm water
	c. Saltwater
	d. All of the above

[Not quite! Corals don’t live everywhere because they require very specific conditions to survive. They need clear water, to allow sunlight to reach zooxanthellae so these algae can make food. Corals also need waters that are between 68-90ºF, are clean and free of sediments, and are salty, with a certain balance in the ratio of salt to water.]


6. Coral reefs are home to what percentage of the world’s marine life?
	a. 5%
	b. 10%
	c. 25%
	d. 50%
	e. 98%

[Not quite! Often referred to as the “rainforests of the sea,” coral reefs support approximately 25 percent of all known marine species.]


7. Hard corals have skeletons made out of:
	a. bone
	b. limestone
